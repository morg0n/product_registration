# OpenEMR Product Registration

This is a very simple REST service that allows new and current OpenEMR users to register their product with OEMR Non Profit. In return, they will receive important software update and security patch email updates. This service will run on AWS (EC2/EBS/SES/RDS) and users of OpenEMR submit their email that will be sent to this remote server.

## REST API OVERVIEW

__HTTP POST /api/registration__
- INPUT: Unique `email` to be stored in MySQL along with a product `uuid`
- OUTPUT: `{"productId": "55cd33ef-f6dd-4d28-925d-d652da3d70b2" }` HTTP 201
- THROWS: `AlreadyRegisteredException` HTTP 409, `InvalidEmailException` HTTP 400

__HTTP POST /api/registration/broadcast__
- INPUT: `secretPin`, `title`, and `contents` to be sent to all registered users
- OUTPUT: `{"status": "sent"}` HTTP 200
- THROWS: `InvalidSecretPinException` HTTP 401, `InvalidEmailMessageException` HTTP 400

__HTTP GET /api/registration/unique__
- OUTPUT: ex: `{"count": 9001}` HTTP 200

## PREREQUISITES

- MySQL >= 14.14
- Python >= 2.7
- Pip >= 1.5.4

## RUN

__Setup up database:__

```
> mysql -u your_username -p product_registration < schema.sql
```

__Edit the db connection string in `config.py` (local development):__
```
DB_CONN_STR = 'mysql+pymysql://user:pass@localhost/product_registration'
```

__Install dependencies:__

```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

__Spin up server (local development):__

```
> python app.py --dev
```

## TRANSLATIONS

This service is simple enough at the moment that the HTTP return statuses will indicate what to display to a consumer with reading the contents of the message. For instance, `AlreadyRegisteredException` throws a HTTP 409 and `InvalidEmailException` throws a HTTP 400. Both of these statuses will be handled in OpenEMR layer with custom user messages that are translated.

The only exception at this time is with the `HTTP POST /api/registration/broadcast` endpoint, which returns various HTTP responses that one will need to see the contents of (which are written in english). However, this is acceptable because this endpoint is to be used exclusively by the OEMR Non Profit board which is all english speaking.

## LOGS

_Note the following about the oemr IAM user:_
- is a service user
- has the following permissions:
  - IAMFullAccess
  - AdministratorAccess
  - AWSElasticBeanstalkService

_Note the following AWS gotchas:_
- You must name the main file `application.py`
- You must name the Flask object `application`
- You must call `application.run(host='0.0.0.0')` as `application.run()` doesn't expose the server properly
- If you add a new environment variable, add it to environment-variables.config as eb needs a default
- Pay close attention to what REGION you are setting up services in. For instance `us-east-1` is where SES is ran from. If `us-west-2` is specified in the SES emailer code, emails will _not_ send.

## PUSHING CHANGES

When new changes are committed and need to be deployed to production, simply run `> eb deploy product-registration`.

## TODOs

- create "OEMR Non Profit Shared Secrets" document
- migrate legimate dev data
- test emailer when in non-sandbox mode
- point domain to prod and set for https mode only (last step in deploy section)

## POST VERSION 1.0.0 TODOs

- Allow for custom HTML emails
- Allow users to re-registration of email addresses
- Allow users to "opt-out" of emails
- Use a open-emr.org noreply email sender instead of the gmail sender
- Store registration IP address in table to prevent spam (?)

## OEMR Non Profit INSTRUCTIONS

Greetings OEMR Non Profit board. This section intends to explain, in plain english, how to get information about registered users and send them important updates about OpenEMR via bulk emailing.

- To see how many users have registered their OpenEMR instance, direct your browser to [https://reg.open-emr.org/api/registration/unique](https://reg.open-emr.org/api/registration/unique). This will return a count of registered users. Please note you will need to total this number with that of SourceForge downloads (there is overlap here, of course).

- To email all registered users an important update email about OpenEMR, download and run [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) Chrome application. Configure postman/compose your message as seen below (note the "secretPin" lives in the OEMR Non Profit Shared Secrets document):
